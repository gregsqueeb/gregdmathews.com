                    <p class="case-study-body">Nerdwallet helps users find the best financial products, and answers those tough money questions. While at Nerdwallet I helped build out their design system, re-designed some of the highest grossing pages, and pitched then designed the initial version of the consumer product.</p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Credit Score v1</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body mbm">Nerdwallet started as the best way to find a new credit card, and moved into helping people answer life's financial questions. A big problem with relying on people asking questions is they have to know they have a question in the first place.</p>
                <p class="case-study-body">We wanted to make a product that would have a lasting relationship with our users. Credit score is a number that underlies almost every large financial decision, so we decided to start there. After pitching a product to help users with this problem, a Product Manager and I got to kick it off with a small team.</p>

                    <p class="case-study-body mbm">To kick off the start of this product we ran a google design sprint process. We had a User Researcher, Product Manager, and Engineers in the room. We brought in our experts on credit score to give us a base of knowledge, we looked at competitors to see what they were doing well and what we could improve upon, and then build a rough wireframe prototype.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-body">Through testing we learned that the main problems with credit score were that people didn't understand what makes up a credit score, and they didn't know how to improve their score.</p>

                        <p class="case-study-body">To help people understand what makes up their credit score we made sure the UI focused on the 6 main factors of their score. The factors were ordered by most impactful to least, and included an overview of how the user was doing in each factor so they could quickly understand where they need to focus to improve.</p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">How to Improve</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body mbm">One of the biggest learnings that we gathered about how current competitors were lacking was the fact that nobody told you how to improve your credit score. The third party API we were using had a credit score simulator but users had to proactively try out the simulator and guess what might improve their score. </p>
                <p class="case-study-body">We flipped this around and selectively chose numbers that would most likely cause increases in people's scores and then ran the simulations for them and presented them with the results. This ended up giving people actionable insights and ways they could increase their score.</p>
