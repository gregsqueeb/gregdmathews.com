                <p class="case-study-body mbm">Nerdwallet started as the best way to find a new credit card, and moved into helping people answer life's financial questions. A big problem with relying on people asking questions is they have to know they have a question in the first place. A lot of people don't even know where to start asking questions with their financial life.</p>
                <p class="case-study-body">We wanted to make a product that would have a lasting relationship with our users. After pitching a product to help users with this problem, a Product Manager and I got to kick it off with a small team.</p>
