                    <p class="case-study-body">Nerdwallet helps users find the best financial products, and answers those tough money questions. While at Nerdwallet I helped build out their design system, re-designed some of the highest grossing pages, and pitched/designed the initial version of the consumer product.</p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Credit Score v1</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body mbm">Nerdwallet started as the best way to find a new credit card, and moved into helping people answer life's financial questions. A big problem with relying on people asking questions is they have to know they have a question in the first place.</p>
                <p class="case-study-body">We wanted to make a product that would have a lasting relationship with our users so that we could be there when users have a question, and suggest ways they could improve before they think to have a question. Credit score is a number that underlies almost every large financial decision, so we started there. After pitching this product, and getting the go ahead, a Product Manger and I got the green light to assemble a team of two engineers to build out the first version.</p>

                    <p class="case-study-body mbm">To kick off this project we ran a google design sprint. We had a User Researcher, Product Manager, and Engineers in the room. We brought in our experts on credit score to give us a base of knowledge. We looked at competitors to see what they were doing well and what we could improve upon, and then built a rough wireframe prototype that we tested with real users.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-body">Through testing we learned that the main problems with credit score were that people didn't understand what makes up a credit score, and they didn't know how to improve their score.</p>

                        <p class="case-study-body">The UI focused on the six main factors that contribute to credit score. The factors were ordered by most impactful to least, and included an overview of how the user was doing in each factor so they could quickly understand where they need to focus to improve. In addition to this we included explanations of what the factors were and additional articles to further educate the users.</p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">How to Improve</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body mbm">One of the biggest learnings that we gathered about where current competitors were lacking was the fact that nobody told you how to improve your credit score. The third party API we were using had a credit score simulator but users had to proactively try out the simulator and guess what might improve their score.</p>
                <p class="case-study-body mbl">We flipped this around and selectively chose numbers that would most likely cause increases in people's scores and then ran the simulations for them and presented them with the results. This ended up giving people actionable insights and ways they could increase their score.</p>
                <h2 class="case-study-header">Results</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body mbm">In a quarter we were able to grow from 5k users to ~150k users. We proved that credit score was something that people were extremely interested in and that they wanted to learn how to improve their situation.</p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Expanding from credit score</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body">Since the beginning we knew we wanted to build something that expanded beyond credit score. With our initial design we proved the worth of credit score which set us up to be able to build the team bigger and expand the product to encompass more parts of people's financial life. To further what questions we could answer about peopleâ€™s financial lives we wanted to expand into categories such as transactions, home value, auto, wealth, etc. With all the additional categories we needed to rethink how our dashboard is structured and how the navigation would work in the future.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <h2 class="case-study-header">Expandable Navigation</h2>
                    <p class="case-study-body">The main constraint of the previous design was our navigation. We wanted to create a navigation pattern that could expand way past credit score. We ended up opting to use a sidebar navigation with the option to use expandable categories. This way we would be able to fit any navigation category when we needed it in the future.</p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Updated dashboard</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body">With our updated dashboard we wanted to focus on making something that would be modular, and could expand. We ended up introducing a homepage for the logged in experience which surfaces the most important information to focus on. The content is modular and can include various content types from relevant articles, to the latest spending update. Other teams were able to add to this homepage with relevant articles or tips for the users. </p>

                <h2 class="case-study-header">Motion System</h2>
                <p class="case-study-body">The last piece we added was a motion system when navigating. This helped the user make sense of how the page was changing. When the page initially loads, or you change categories, the content loads in from right to left. When you change to a new category the content fades down and away, and when you navigate deeper into a category the content fades back and away and the new content comes in from the right.</p>

                    <p class="case-study-body mbm">In the same quarter we built this new navigation and dashboard design we were able to grow the product from 150k users to 500k users. The new design set up the future of where the product was heading. This ended up being my last project at Nerdwallet, after Nerdwallet I contracted at <a class="text-link" href="./babylist.html">babylist</a> for a few months and then took a full time job at <a class="text-link" href="./smash.html">smash.gg</a>.</p>
