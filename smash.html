                    <p class="case-study-body mbm">Smash.gg is becoming the place where the esports industry does their work. Organizers run their tournaments, the best players represent themselves, and all the results are made on smash.gg. However, we noticed that the way we were representing these profiles were inconsistent, and couldn’t share a lot of the same functionality.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-body mbm">Navigation between different profile types was inconsistent and made it harder for users to jump between different profile types and navigate easily. Owners of multiple profiles expected to have access to similar functionality, but features were built one off for specific profiles. It was unclear how profiles were connected to other profiles.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-body">After looking at the growing list of profiles we wanted to support we started to come up with a framework for profiles that would solve these problems. I then took these ideas and created a profile design framework for how profiles work on smash.gg</p>
